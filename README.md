## Project Introduction

In an era where digital media is central to both personal expression and professional documentation, there is a growing demand for cloud-based platforms that provide users with a streamlined, secure, and user-friendly experience. Existing solutions often fall short by either overcomplicating the sharing process or overloading users with extraneous features. PixShare: Cloud-Based Media Storage and Sharing Platform addresses this gap by offering a clean, intuitive interface for uploading, organizing, and privately sharing photos and videos. Whether users are hosting an event, capturing life moments, or managing creative work, PixShare provides the necessary tools for reliable media storage and flexible sharing, tailored to both casual users and professionals.

The capstone project aims to build a scalable web application that combines robust cloud storage with privacy-focused sharing features and a clear upgrade path through a freemium model. With a mobile-responsive design built in React.js and supported by a Flask backend and Azure cloud services, PixShare is designed to meet evolving user needs, including future expansion into in-browser photo editing. By prioritizing ease of use, privacy, and scalability, this platform empowers individuals, families, and event organizers to manage and share digital media effortlessly—while giving administrators the control and insights needed to ensure smooth platform operation.
